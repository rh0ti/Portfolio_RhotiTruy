# Portfolio Rhoti Truy

Hi, I'm Rhoti. 👨🏾‍💻👋 
Welcome to my Portfolio!🎋

I'm a Web Development student with a Diploma graduation date of February 2021 and 
a Bachelor graduation date of August 2022. Before my studies, I graduated from KV Business School in Zurich and worked more than 5 years as an accountant and in the human resources department.

As a Web Developer I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs. I want to keep learning and growing as much as possible to be able to work in my dream job as a Web Developer and Designer in the future.

Send me a message if you'd like to connect! I'm always happy to support others and also meet new people and learn from them.
